# CreateProject
This is a bash script for initializing a project using npm, it will download and save webpack and jest as dev dependencies automatically and create boilerplate html and file systems that are all connected!

## How to use

1. Place script in a directory that is on your $PATH, I used `/usr/local/bin`, this allows this script to be ran anywhere on the machine without having to use a path to it. 
2. Go to or create your project file where you want all the files to be and use `createProject` to create the files and run npm!
